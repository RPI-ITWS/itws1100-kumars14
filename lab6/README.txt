Observations and Comments from Lab 6:
-Had to go to jQuery API and site to understand some functions to add to the Javascript file.
-Found it cool how to integrate the jQuery into javascript.

Problem 4b:
When you click on the new li nothing happens. This means the new li won't turn red like the normal list item does when it is clicked. This occurs because the new li is in another function that does not establish the li turning red when clicked.
