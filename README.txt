Comments and Observations About Lab 3
* Had trouble pairing my Github with my Azure Instance
* Learned that I have to pull from Github each time I make a change to each file 
* Was confused on where to start my webpage but Professor Plotka helped 
* Ran into trouble with my project file CSS and then realized I had to create another CSS file for it
* Tried incorporating an icon of a laptop onto my homepage from fontawesome (learned through w3schools) but wasn’t working. 
* I love the color purple that’s why I put it for my own webpage
